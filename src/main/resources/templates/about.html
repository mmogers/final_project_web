            <h2>Santa</h2>
            <p> I'm an aspiring software developer, and Kids' Puzzle has been my first real project that has produced a tangible result. 
                I took great pleasure in the process of creating this mobile game - I loved working both on back-end and front-end of the app. 
                Inspiration for this game came from my little daughter - she enjoys 
                puzzles a lot, and I wanted her to have a chance to create a puzzle out of any picture she desired. Therefore this game lets 
                you not only to choose from the images we have provided, but also to use your phone's camera and gallery. Turns out this game 
                is fun also for my older child and myself as well, because the timer allows us to compete for the fastest puzzle assembly time. 
                Working on this app was a very exciting experience and I was lucky to have team members who were easy to work with. 
                Together we have managed to create something that not only works, but also is pleasant to look at and use.

            <h2>Alija</h2>
            <p>I decided to be a part of this project because I really like to do puzzles. 
                To me puzzle assembly is a hobby, that lets me have some rest at the end of a hard day. 
                For kids this game is not only interesting, but also useful. Putting together puzzles improves memory and concentration. 
                It helps kids understand that small details are important for the full picture. 
                In order to assemble the full image child has to invest time and patience. 
                All what I mentioned is very helpful to raise a kid, who understands that he needs 
                to invest time, patience and focus to see the results. 
                I really enjoyed developing application for kids with such great group members. 
                Together we found the productive ways how to work on application. And I really hope 
                that this application will be interesting and enjoyable not only for kids but also for parents.</p>

                I wanted to create this puzzle game for my 2 years old kid, who loves puzzles.
                I also wanted to try myself out in web development, and it indeed was a very exciting journey. 
                My smaller kid loves playing our puzzle game - his favourite feature is the sound when the puzzle is completed. 
                Surprisingly, my 10 years old kid also enjoys using our app. He is very competitive and thanks to the timer he 
                 can compete against other users. I enjoyed working with my team-mates, I found it very productive and interesting 
                 to work in a group, as it allows to observe things from others' point of view.</p>
